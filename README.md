Foundations: HTML Foundations: Recipes Project

Before Project:
I will create a basic recipes website using html. The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
I will apply boilerplates, create 3 recipe pages with headings, images, paragraphs, unordered, and ordered lists, and finally link these pages to my main index page. 
I will also create new directories to store the contents of this website and practice staging and commiting my process on my local machine before pushing my final product onto the Github repository.

After Project Reflection:
Don't forget to add alt text for images
Need to adjust size of images using CSS later. 
Html concepts for this project were relatively simple. 
Using the terminal to stage, commit, and push to Github was more of a challenge.
-Learned git pull and the importance of fetching and merging prior to making new commits in the local branch. 
-Learned how to create and enter a commit message to conclude a merge.
