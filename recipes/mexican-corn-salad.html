    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This salad was inspired by the recipes I've seen for grilled Mexican corn on the cob--mayo, lime, cotija cheese--just adjusted for those that would rather not eat corn on the cob or to save time (and grill space) during your bbq! Can be served cold or at room temp.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 ears corn, with husks</li>
        <li>½ lime, juiced, or more to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>5 ounces crumbled cotija cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup packed chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Grill corn in the husks on the preheated grill, turning occasionally, to desired tenderness, about 15 minutes; some charring is fine. Remove from the grill. Remove and discard husks and silk when cool enough to handle. Cut kernels off into a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Add lime juice and chili powder, then mix in cotija cheese, cilantro, mayonnaise, and pepper until thoroughly combined. Taste and add salt if necessary.</li>
    </ol>
